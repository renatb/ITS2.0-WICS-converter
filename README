NAME
    ITS::WICS - Work with ITS-decorated documents

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        use ITS::WICS qw(xml2html);
        my $html = xml2html('path/to/file.xml');
        print $$html;

DESCRIPTION
    WICS stands for Work In Context System. As a project, it is meant to
    make Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) metadata contained in a document
    more accessible to end-users via extraction and visualization.

    This module provides access to the four WICS conversion tasks (see the
    "EXPORTS" section). Two standalone applications, a GUI and a CLI, are
    also provided in this distribution (see WICS-GUI.pl and WICS.pl).

EXPORTS
    The following subroutines may be exported:

  "xml2html"
    Converts input XML data into HTML5 while keeping the ITS information
    intact. See "ITS::WICS::XML2HTML" for more details.

    Argument is either a string containing an XML file name, a string
    pointer containing actual XML data, or a filehandle for a file
    containing the data.

    Return value is a pointer to a string containing the output HTML5 text.

  "xliff2html"
    Converts input XLIFF data into HTML5 while keeping the ITS information
    for "source" and "target" elements intact.

    The first argument is either a string containing an XLIFF file name, a
    string pointer containing actual XLIFF data, or a filehandle for a file
    containing the data. The second argument is a boolean indicating whether
    informative labels should be added (for empty or duplicate targets).

    Return value is a pointer to a string containing the output HTML5 text.

  "xml2xliff"
    Extracts translation units and ITS information from input XML data and
    creates an XLIFF file. This function uses "sec" elements to create
    "group"s, and "para" elements to make "trans-unit"s. Keep in mind that
    this functionality is still highly immature.

    The first argument is either a string containing an XML file name, a
    string pointer containing actual XML data, or a filehandle for a file
    containing the data.

    Return value is a pointer to a string containing the output XLIFF text.

  "reduceHtml"
    Consolidates ITS-decorated HTML5 by placing all external rules in the
    head element.

    The input and return values are the same as for "xml2HTML", except that
    the input should refer to HTML5 data instead of XML.

SEE ALSO
    This module relies on the ITS module for processing ITS markup and
    rules.

    The modules for the various ITS data conversion are included in this
    distribution:

    ITS::WICS::Reduce
